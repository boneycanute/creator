# Typeform Clone Requirements

## Design Philosophy
- **Monochromatic Design**: Pure black and white color scheme throughout the entire UI
  - Black for all text and accent elements
  - White for backgrounds
  - No other colors whatsoever
- **Animation-Rich**: Utilize Framer Motion for smooth, modern animations throughout the experience
- **Minimalist**: Clean, focused UI with minimal distractions
- **Mobile-First**: Design optimized for mobile devices first, then scaled up for larger screens

## Core Functionality
- **One Question at a Time**: Display only a single question/section in the center of the screen
- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Press Enter to submit the current answer and move to the next question
  - Press Escape to return to the previous question/section
- **Touch-Friendly**: Easy touch targets and swipe gestures for mobile users
- **Custom Sections**: Ability to create and customize different sections with their own questions
- **Centered Layout**: All content should be centered on the screen for focus
- **Voice Input**: Allow users to speak their answers which will be transcribed automatically

## User Experience Flow
1. User arrives at a section with a question
2. User inputs their answer (by typing or speaking)
3. User presses Enter (or clicks/taps a button) to submit and move to the next question
4. Animation transitions between questions
5. User can press Escape (or use a back gesture/button on mobile) to go back to previous questions and modify answers

## UI Components
Based on the existing components in the project, we'll leverage:

### Existing Components to Utilize
- **Button**: For navigation and submission actions
- **InterruptPrompt**: Can be modified to show keyboard shortcut hints
- **MessageInput**: Can be adapted for question responses (includes voice typing capability)
- **AnimatePresence/motion**: From Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **AudioVisualizer**: For voice input visualization
- **useAudioRecording Hook**: Manages recording states and audio transcription

### Voice Input Capabilities
The project already includes robust voice input functionality:
- **Audio Recording**: Using the `useAudioRecording` hook which handles:
  - Starting/stopping recording
  - Managing recording states (isRecording, isTranscribing)
  - Sending audio blobs to transcription function
  - Handling transcribed text results
- **UI Components**:
  - Microphone button for starting recordings
  - Audio visualizer to show waveforms during recording
  - Recording controls and overlays for user feedback
  - Transcription status indicators

### New Components to Create
- **Section**: Container for a single question/prompt
- **SectionTransition**: Handles animations between sections
- **NavigationHint**: Shows keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape) and touch gestures
- **FormProgress**: Optional subtle indicator of progress (without a progress bar)
- **ResponseInput**: Specialized input for different types of responses (text, multiple choice, etc.)
- **MobileControls**: Touch-optimized navigation controls for mobile users

## Animation Requirements
- **Section Entry**: Smooth animation when a new section appears
- **Section Exit**: Elegant animation when moving to the next section
- **Input Focus**: Subtle animations for input fields when focused
- **Button Interactions**: Responsive animations for hover/click/touch states
- **Error States**: Gentle animations for validation errors
- **Recording States**: Animations for audio recording and transcription processes
- **Touch Feedback**: Visual feedback for touch interactions on mobile

## Technical Considerations
- **State Management**: Track current section, user responses, and navigation history
- **Keyboard Event Handling**: Capture Enter/Escape keypresses
- **Touch Event Handling**: Handle swipe gestures and touch interactions
- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Mobile-first approach with fluid layouts
  - Appropriate text sizes and input fields for all devices
  - Touch targets at least 44x44px for mobile users
  - Viewport adaptations for various screen sizes
  - Virtual keyboard considerations on mobile
- **Accessibility**: Maintain accessibility despite the animation-rich interface
- **Voice Input Integration**: 
  - Connect the `transcribeAudio` function to handle speech-to-text conversion
  - Manage recording states and user feedback
  - Handle errors gracefully during recording or transcription

## Implementation Approach
1. Create the core section component with Framer Motion animations
2. Implement the navigation system (Enter/Escape keys and touch gestures)
3. Develop the input components for different question types
4. Build the state management to track responses
5. Add transition animations between sections
6. Implement keyboard shortcut indicators and touch guides
7. Integrate voice input functionality using existing hooks and components
8. Ensure responsive behavior across devices
9. Test and optimize for mobile devices

## Mobile-Specific Considerations
- **Virtual Keyboard Handling**: Adjust layout when virtual keyboard appears
- **Touch Targets**: Ensure all interactive elements are large enough for touch
- **Swipe Navigation**: Implement intuitive swipe gestures for navigation
- **Portrait/Landscape**: Optimize layout for both orientations
- **Performance**: Ensure animations remain smooth on lower-powered devices
- **Network Considerations**: Handle voice transcription efficiently on mobile networks

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Save progress for returning users
- Export responses to various formats
- Branching logic based on responses
- Custom themes while maintaining monochromatic design
- Enhanced voice input capabilities:
  - Voice command navigation
  - Multilingual support
  - Real-time transcription feedback
- Progressive Web App capabilities for offline use on mobile

## Development Priorities
1. Core navigation and section transitions
2. Mobile-responsive input components
3. Touch and keyboard shortcut system
4. Voice input integration
5. Polish animations and transitions
6. Mobile testing and optimization
